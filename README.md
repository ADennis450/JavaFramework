Java Cucumber-Selenium Framework

This is a basic Java Selenium-Cucumber framework I created for fun

Quick set up instructions

1. Create a folder on your C drive called SeleniumDrivers and dowload chromedriver.exe and geckodriver.exe(for firefox) into that folder.

2. In order to run the test, add a maven configuration with the command line clean test.

3. Test results will be under target/cucumber-html-report

That's it have fun.
